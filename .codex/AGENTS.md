## Obsidian Brain

Use the user's Obsidian vault as persistent long-term memory across Codex sessions.

Vault path:
- First read `~/.codex/obsidian-brain-path`.
- If that is missing or invalid, fall back to `~/.claude/obsidian-brain-path`.

Brain folder:
- Use `<vault>/Claude Brain/`.
- The folder name and existing `claude-brain` / `#CLAUDE_BRAIN` tags are kept for compatibility with the existing Obsidian graph and Claude Code setup. Treat it as the shared AI brain, not as Claude-only storage.

At the start of relevant work:
- Use `<vault>/Claude Brain/_Index.md` as the map of what the brain contains. The SessionStart hook may already have printed it; if it is visible in the current context, do not reread it just to satisfy this instruction.
- After checking the index, load only the notes needed for the task at hand.
- Read the project note matching the current repository only when one exists under `Projects/Work/`, `Projects/Hobby/`, or `Projects/Side-Projects/`.
- Read `Preferences/coding-conventions.md` for code, docs, git, or workflow changes.
- Read related `Learnings/` or `Decisions/` notes only when the task overlaps with them.
- Do not read the whole vault, whole folders, or old session notes by default.

After meaningful work:
- Proactively write or update Obsidian Brain notes before the final response when the session produced a feature, bug fix, refactor, technical decision, reusable learning, project setup detail, or important user preference.
- Prefer updating an existing note over creating a duplicate.
- If you create a note, add a link to `[[_Index]]`, cross-link related notes, and update `_Index.md`.
- Keep notes concise, factual, and useful months later.
- Skip note writes for trivial questions, one-line changes, or exploratory work with no concrete outcome.
